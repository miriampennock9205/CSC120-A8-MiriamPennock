Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
My superhero game class is an interactive superhero adventure where players can control Captain Nova to stop a villain using superpowers. It implements methods from Contract, where you can grab items, walk, use powers, etc. 
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
I didn't add any methods, however I did include narrative elements and state tracking of things like bombFound and citySaved.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

What worked: I had a really fun time designing this game. I originally was making a simpler thing, and then I decided I wanted to make something a bit more complex. I wasn't sure if it would work (because I was making a more complex thing) so I made a new separate file to test things out and then once it worked I copied the whole class into here. And it didn't break when I did that which was exciting.

What didn't: It was a little tricky since I made this more complicated than necessary to make sure everything worked and made sense, but that's okay because it was fun.

Advice: Start early and brainstorm. Test regularly. Have fun with the freedom of this assignment.




Cheat Sheet of Commands in Order: 
> walk center city
> use x-ray vision
> grab bomb
> use super speed
> use healing powers

Those are all the commands you *need* to use in order to save the city, however the other commands all work they just aren't needed to win. I didn't have time to make it quite that complex....
